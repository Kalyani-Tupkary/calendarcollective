                The French Republican Revolutionary Calendar established a new
                timekeeping system from 1793 until 1806. “This was introduced
                not to correct some astronomical discrepancy but to mark a break
                with the past. The Church, the guardian of the calendar with its
                feasts and fasts and saints’ days was one of the sources of
                power of the hated ancient order; it had to be done away with.”1
                It employed ‘decimal time’ in order to be rational (in contrast
                to religious “irrationality”), and parallel the metric system.
                Using metric time was a proclamation that all Frenchmen became
                equal. A year had 12 months of 30 days each with 5 days at the
                year-end. Hence its power lay in its symbolic value rather than
                practical purpose. A leap year was to have an extra intercalary
                day. Months were standardized into three equal decades of 10
                days each, each day was divided into 10 hours, hours into 100
                minutes, and minutes into 100 seconds. This period also saw
                watchmakers build decimal clocks and watches. “Despite its
                revolutionary symbolism, the new calendar turned out to be
                unpopular and inconvenient. The French workman objected to
                working a 10-day week; most people objected to working on
                Sundays; the decimal hours caused intolerable confusion;
                business with the rest of Europe (still adhering to the
                Gregorian calendar) became difficult. As revolutionary fervour
                ebbed away, the provisions of the calendar were gradually
                repealed. In September 1805, Sunday was restored as the day of
                rest, and from 1 January 1806, the Gregorian calendar was
                reinstated.”
