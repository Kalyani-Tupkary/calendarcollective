                It was in May of 1929, at the fifth Congress of the Soviets of
                the Union, that it was proposed to alter the existing work-week
                in order to utilize expensive machinery in the factories more
                effectively and so raise productivity. The proposer, Larin,
                managed to interest Stalin in the project and on 26 August of
                the same year, the Council of People's Commissaries announced
                that the old work-week would be abolished and be replaced by a
                continuous production week known as 'nepreryvka'. A decree of 24
                September modified the proposal by replacing the seven­day cycle
                with a five ­day one. The workers were issued with coloured
                slips of paper to tell them which day to take off: yellow,
                orange, red, purple, and green. They were to observe a day off
                on the day that fell on their colour.

                <br /><br />
                While it did increase productivity as intended (80 per cent of
                the country was working at any given time), it disrupted social
                system by segregating families and friends, workers were
                demoralized, and machines could not be routinely maintained.
                However, there were two main disadvantages to nepreryvka. First,
                it had a profound, disruptive, and unwelcome effect on family
                and social life; members of the same family, friends, or
                marriage partners, who had been given different colours.
                Although the Soviet workers got more time off than then Western
                counterparts they were rarely able to spend time together.
