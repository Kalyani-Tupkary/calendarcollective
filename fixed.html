                In a scalding-hot argument against the 12-month calendar, a
                September 1927 issue of The Outlook proclaimed: 'A month is a
                wholly irrational division of time. It has no relation to
                anything in astronomy, or human experience. It is an inaccurate
                and varying measure of time that is a constant annoyance in
                business and a misleading unit in science. It has no religious
                significance. A month is nothing but just a bad habit.'
                <br /><br /> 
                The International Fixed Calendar is a
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar"

                  >solar calendar</a
                >
                with 13 months of 28 days each. It is a
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_calendar"

                  >perennial calendar</a
                >
                as every date is fixed to the same weekday every year. Momentum
                behind the International Fixed Calendar, a 13-month calendar
                with 28 days in each month and a leftover day at the end of each
                year (it also followed the Gregorian rules with regards to Leap
                Years), was never stronger than in the late 1920s. Similar to
                Auguste Comte's
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivist_calendar"
                  targer="_blank"
                  >positivist calendar</a
                >
                (created in 1849), this particular 13-month invention came from
                the mind of Moses Cotsworth, a North Eastern Railway advisor
                bothered by inexplicably varying monthly earnings over the
                traditional 12-month period. In 1902, driven by a desire to
                simplify the ‘irrational calendar’ Moses B Cotsworth presented a
                solar calendar for calendar reform. His solar calendar had 13
                months of 28 days each. Every date was fixed to the same weekday
                every year. Every week starts with a Sunday and ends with a
                Saturday. Cotsworth's plan quickly gained popularity among
                businessmen, especially in transportation and logistics. His
                biggest ally, however, was photography pioneer and Kodak
                founder, George Eastman. Impressed by the symmetry of this
                hyper-rational calendar, George Eastman adopted it for use in
                his Eastman Kodak Company 1928 to 1989 while the rest of the
                world followed the Gregorian calendar.
