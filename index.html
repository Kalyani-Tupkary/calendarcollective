              Calendar Collective is a living archive of alternate calendars. It
              is an ongoing investigation for collecting, cataloguing and
              publishing calendars that are little-known to our world. We use
              openly contributed voicemails as are our unique research material.
              The archive offers an uncommon collection of calendars traced
              through these unwritten and slightly incongruous fragments.

                In a scalding-hot argument against the 12-month calendar, a
                September 1927 issue of The Outlook proclaimed: 'A month is a
                wholly irrational division of time. It has no relation to
                anything in astronomy, or human experience. It is an inaccurate
                and varying measure of time that is a constant annoyance in
                business and a misleading unit in science. It has no religious
                significance. A month is nothing but just a bad habit.'
                <br /><br />
                The International Fixed Calendar is a
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar"

                  >solar calendar</a
                >
                with 13 months of 28 days each. It is a
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_calendar"

                >
                as every date is fixed to the same weekday every year. Momentum
                behind the International Fixed Calendar, a 13-month calendar
                with 28 days in each month and a leftover day at the end of each
                year (it also followed the Gregorian rules with regards to Leap
                Years), was never stronger than in the late 1920s. Similar to
                Auguste Comte's
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivist_calendar"

                  >positivist calendar</a
                >
                (created in 1849), this particular 13-month invention came from
                the mind of Moses Cotsworth, a North Eastern Railway advisor
                bothered by inexplicably varying monthly earnings over the
                traditional 12-month period. In 1902, driven by a desire to
                simplify the ‘irrational calendar’ Moses B Cotsworth presented a
                solar calendar for calendar reform. His solar calendar had 13
                months of 28 days each. Every date was fixed to the same weekday
                every year. Every week starts with a Sunday and ends with a
                Saturday. Cotsworth's plan quickly gained popularity among
                businessmen, especially in transportation and logistics. His
                biggest ally, however, was photography pioneer and Kodak
                founder, George Eastman. Impressed by the symmetry of this
                hyper-rational calendar, George Eastman adopted it for use in
                his Eastman Kodak Company 1928 to 1989 while the rest of the
                world followed the Gregorian calendar.

              <p>
                The French Republican Revolutionary Calendar established a new
                timekeeping system from 1793 until 1806. “This was introduced
                not to correct some astronomical discrepancy but to mark a break
                with the past. The Church, the guardian of the calendar with its
                feasts and fasts and saints’ days was one of the sources of
                power of the hated ancient order; it had to be done away with.”1
                It employed ‘decimal time’ in order to be rational (in contrast
                to religious “irrationality”), and parallel the metric system.
                Using metric time was a proclamation that all Frenchmen became
                equal. A year had 12 months of 30 days each with 5 days at the
                year-end. Hence its power lay in its symbolic value rather than
                practical purpose. A leap year was to have an extra intercalary
                day. Months were standardized into three equal decades of 10
                days each, each day was divided into 10 hours, hours into 100
                minutes, and minutes into 100 seconds. This period also saw
                watchmakers build decimal clocks and watches. “Despite its
                revolutionary symbolism, the new calendar turned out to be
                unpopular and inconvenient. The French workman objected to
                working a 10-day week; most people objected to working on
                Sundays; the decimal hours caused intolerable confusion;
                business with the rest of Europe (still adhering to the
                Gregorian calendar) became difficult. As revolutionary fervour
                ebbed away, the provisions of the calendar were gradually
                repealed. In September 1805, Sunday was restored as the day of
                rest, and from 1 January 1806, the Gregorian calendar was
                reinstated.”

                It was in May of 1929, at the fifth Congress of the Soviets of
                the Union, that it was proposed to alter the existing work-week
                in order to utilize expensive machinery in the factories more
                effectively and so raise productivity. The proposer, Larin,
                managed to interest Stalin in the project and on 26 August of
                the same year, the Council of People's Commissaries announced
                that the old work-week would be abolished and be replaced by a
                continuous production week known as 'nepreryvka'. A decree of 24
                September modified the proposal by replacing the seven­day cycle
                with a five ­day one. The workers were issued with coloured
                slips of paper to tell them which day to take off: yellow,
                orange, red, purple, and green. They were to observe a day off
                on the day that fell on their colour.

                <br /><br />
                While it did increase productivity as intended (80 per cent of
                the country was working at any given time), it disrupted social
                system by segregating families and friends, workers were
                demoralized, and machines could not be routinely maintained.
                However, there were two main disadvantages to nepreryvka. First,
                it had a profound, disruptive, and unwelcome effect on family
                and social life; members of the same family, friends, or
                marriage partners, who had been given different colours.
                Although the Soviet workers got more time off than then Western
                counterparts they were rarely able to spend time together.
